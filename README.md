SourceGraph Viewer
----------------

This module is used to visualize in a graphical way various outputs generated by SonarQube Analyzer plugins.

For the time being, the viewer is only working with Java sources and uses the SonarQube Java plugin to generate its output.
When analyzing sources, the viewer produces:

* Exploded Graph (output of the symbolic execution engine)
* Control Flow Graph
* Syntax Tree

Usage
--------

To start the viewer (web app), you have two options:

* execute `main` method from `org.sonar.java.viewer.Viewer` class;
* build and run the web app using command line `mvn exec:java`.

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9999`. Note that default port (`9999`) is currently hardcoded.
